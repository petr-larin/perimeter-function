### About

The *Perimeter* app is a supplement to my candidate's thesis in math, whose topic is the theory of search. The aim of the app is to help illustrate the concept of *perimeter function* introduced in the thesis. Some math background is provided in the file `perimeter.rtf`.

### Audience

As such, the app is mostly intended for those interested in the surrounding theory. However, one particular feature will be understood by anyone: draw a polygon with a mouse (or import it from a file) and then press the Maximum button - this will show the **shortest** curve dividing the polygon into 2 parts **equal in area**.

### Examples

* The 3 polygons defined in the 3 accompanying files `casita?.txt` only slightly differ from each other. Use the Maximum button to see how the shortest splitting curve evolves as the sizes of the sides change.

* The files `regular_poly_????.txt` define regular polygons with different numbers of vertices. Using the Graph button will show the convergence of the polygons' perimeter functions to that of a circle.
